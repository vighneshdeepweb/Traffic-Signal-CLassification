## About The Project
![classify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52296623/150990686-97c8f10c-50d6-45bb-968d-c3cfc475c62a.png)

This Repo is about implementing Real Time Traffic Signal Recognition System by training a CNN model with 95% accuracy and furthur implementing it using a GUI Interface.

### Built With

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)

## Execution
Simply clone the repo and fire up the GUI file in the jupyter notebook select an image from the dataset can be downloaded from above and you are good to go for classification. Cheers :))
